# AI chord generator  -- WORK in progress!!! 
Versie: 0.0.1

## Requirements
It looks like you have a comprehensive set of requirements for building a frontend interface for a musical chord generator. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the tasks and requirements based on your description:

### User Interface

#### Sidebar
- **Dropdowns for:**
  - **Key:** Options include C, C#, D, ..., B.
  - **Scale:** Options include major, minor, pentatonic, etc.
  - **Chord Type:** Options include triad, seventh, augmented, etc.
- **Number input for progression length:** Range from 1 to 16 bars.
- **BPM input:** Default set to 85 BPM.
- **Time signature selection:** Options include 3/4, 4/4, etc.

#### Main Area
- **Canvas element for piano roll visualization.**
- **Playback controls:** Buttons for Play, Pause, and Stop.
- **Virtual piano:** Aligned vertically with MIDI notes on the left side of the piano roll view.
- **Buttons for:**
  - Record MIDI Notes (from external devices like BOSS GM-800).
  - Play MIDI Notes (to external devices like Arturia Minifreak).
  - Save MIDI Notes or settings to JSON file.
  - Load MIDI Notes or settings from JSON file.

### JavaScript Logic
- **Event listeners:** Attach to all inputs and buttons.
- **Mock function:** Generates dummy MIDI notes as if from an AI model.
- **Render generated chords:** Display on the piano roll canvas.
- **Web Audio API:** Play simple sine-wave tones when ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù is clicked.
- **Metronome:** Start ticking at the set BPM when playback starts.

### Responsive Design
- **Layout:** Ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **CSS Flexbox or Grid:** Use for layout structure.

### File Structure
```
frontend/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # Main HTML page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css # Styling for the app
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js # JavaScript logic
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- User can select key, scale, and chord type.
- User can set progression length (1‚Äì16 bars).
- Clicking "Generate Chords" triggers a function and displays output.
- Piano roll draws rectangles representing notes over time.
- Play/Pause/Stop buttons control audio playback of generated chords.
- No backend calls are made yet; all data is mocked.
- All code must run locally without external dependencies.

### Testing Plan
- **Manual testing:** Ensure UI responsiveness and interaction.
- **Edge cases:** Handle invalid input gracefully.
- **Cross-browser compatibility:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Mobile view:** Ensure it works correctly.

### Tools & Technologies
- **VS Code:** IDE for development.
- **Live Server Extension:** For local testing.
- **Git:** Version control (commit early and often).
- **Browser DevTools:** Debugging JavaScript and layout issues.

### Deliverables
- Fully functional `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` files.
- Demo-ready build that runs locally.
- `README.md` explaining how to run and test the frontend.
- Optional: Unit tests for core functions (e.g., chord drawing logic).

This should give you a clear roadmap for developing the frontend interface for your musical chord generator. If you need any further assistance or specific details, feel free to ask!


#  Prompt  using chat.qwlm.ai
As a web developer, your task is to build the frontend interface that allows users to:<br>

Select musical parameters (key, scale, chord type)<br>
Set progression length (number of bars)<br>
Generate chords using mock functionality<br>
View results in a piano roll canvas<br>
Play, pause, and stop playback using Web Audio API<br>

## üìã Requirements
